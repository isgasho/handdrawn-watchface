Built with [`pinetime-watchface`](https://crates.io/crates/pinetime-watchface) framework for watch faces.

To select this watch face, set `WatchFaceType` in [`pinetime-rust-mynewt/rust/app/src/lib.rs`](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-rust-mynewt/blob/master/rust/app/src/lib.rs)

```rust
/// Declare the Watch Face Type
type WatchFaceType = handdrawn_watchface::HandDrawnWatchFace;
```

The WebAssembly Simulator for this watch face was auto-generated by a GitHub Actions Workflow: [`simulator.yml`](.github/workflows/simulator.yml)

Source code for the WebAssembly Simulator is at the [`mynewt`](https://github.com/AppKaki/lvgl-wasm/tree/mynewt) branch of [`github.com/AppKaki/lvgl-wasm`](https://github.com/AppKaki/lvgl-wasm/tree/mynewt)
